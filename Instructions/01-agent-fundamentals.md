# Lab 01: Explore AI Agent development

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will create and configure an AI agent using the Microsoft Foundry portal to assist employees with expense claims. You will build a project, define agent instructions, and ground responses using an expense policy document. Finally, you will test the agent in the playground by asking policy questions and generating an expense claim file that you can download and review.

> **Note:** Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you'll perform the following tasks:

- **Task 1:** Create a Foundry project and agent

- **Task 2:** Configure your agent

- **Task 3:** Test your agent

    ![](./Media/lab2-s6.png)

    > **Note:** Copy and save the **Project endpoint** in a notepad, as it will be required in upcoming labs.

## Task 2: Configure your agent

In this task, you will configure your agent by adding instructions, uploading an expense policy document for grounding, and enabling the required tools.

1. Open another browser tab, and download [Expenses_policy.docx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/01-agent-fundamentals/Expenses_Policy.docx) from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/01-agent-fundamentals/Expenses_Policy.docx` and save it locally. This document contains details of the expenses policy for the fictional Contoso corporation.

1. Return to the browser tab where you have the playground open for your expense agent.

1. In **Instructions (1)**, enter the provided prompt text

    ```prompt
   You are an AI assistant for corporate expenses.
   You answer questions about expenses based on the expenses policy data.
   If a user wants to submit an expense claim, you get their email address, a description of the claim, and the amount to be claimed and write the claim details to a text file that the user can download.
    ```

1. Below the **Instructions**, expand the **Tools** section. Select **Upload files (2)**

    ![](./Media/lab1-s10.png)

1. Keep the default values for the **Index option** and **Vector index name**.

1. Select the **browse for files** option to upload the **Expenses_policy.docx** local file that you downloaded previously.

      ![](./Media/lab1-s11.png)

1. In the **Open dialog** box, select **Downloads (1)**, choose the **expenses_policy file (2)**, and then select **Open (3)** to upload the file.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s12.png)

1. When your file is successfully uploaded, select **Attach**.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s13.png)

1. In the **Tools** section, verify that a new **File search (1)** is listed and shown as containing 1 file.

1. In the **Tools** section, select **Add (2)**.

    ![](./Media/lab1-02-6.png)

1. In the **Select a tool** dialog box, select **Code interpreter (1)** and then select **Add tool (2)** (you do not need to upload any files for the code interpreter).

    ![](./Media/lab1-s15.png)

    - Your agent will use the document you uploaded as its knowledge source to *ground* its responses (in other words, it will answer questions based on the contents of this document). It will use the code interpreter tool as required to perform actions by generating and running its own Python code.

1. On the **expense-agent** page, select **Save**.

    ![](./Media/lab1-02-7.png)

## Task 3: Test your agent

In this task, you will test your configured agent in the playground by asking policy-related questions and submitting an expense claim to verify its responses and actions.

1. In the **Playground** chat box, enter `What's the maximum I can claim for meals?` **(1)**, and then select **Send (2)**.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s17.png)

1. Review the agent’s response and confirm it is based on the uploaded **Expenses_Policy.docx** knowledge source.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s17.1.png)

    > **Note:** If the agent fails to respond because the rate limit is exceeded. Wait a few seconds and try again. If there is insufficient quota available in your subscription, the model may not be able to respond. If the problem persists, try to increase the quota for your model on the **Models** page.

1. Try the following follow-up prompt: `I'd like to submit a claim for a meal.` and review the response. The agent should ask you for the required information to submit a claim.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s18.png)

1. Provide the agent with an email address; for example, `fred@contoso.com`. The agent should acknowledge the response and request the remaining information required for the expense claim (description and amount)

    ![](./Media/lab1-s19.png)

1. Submit a prompt that describes the claim and the amount; for example, `Breakfast cost me $20`.

1. The agent should use the code interpreter to prepare the expense claim text file, and provide a link so you can download it.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s20.png)

1. Download and open the text document to see the expense claim details.

## Optional: Explore the code

After experimenting with your agent in the playground, you may want to integrate it into your own client application. The **Code** tab provides sample code that shows how to interact with your agent programmatically.

1. In the agent playground, select the **Code** tab to view the sample code.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s21.png)

1. Review the Python code. This code demonstrates how to:
    - Connect to your agent using the Azure AI Projects SDK
    - Send messages to the agent
    - Retrieve and process responses
    
1. Select **.env variables** to view the environment variables you need to run this code.

    ![](./Media/lab1-s22.png)

1. You can use this code as a starting point for building your own client application that interacts with the agent you created.

1. Optionally, select **Open in VS Code for the Web** to launch a preconfigured workspace with the sample code ready to run.

    > **Note:** It may take a few minutes for the workspace to be prepared. Follow the instructions provided in the workspace to successfully run the code.

## Summary

In this lab, you created a new project in the Microsoft Foundry portal and built an AI agent to assist with expense claims. You configured the agent with system instructions and added an expense policy document as grounding data. You also enabled the code interpreter tool so the agent could perform actions. Finally, you tested the agent in the playground by asking policy questions and generating an expense claim file to download and review.
